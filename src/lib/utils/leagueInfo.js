  <p>Ye Olde Dynasty League<br>Est. Anno Domini 2026</p>
  <p>In the year of our gridiron Lord two-thousand and six-and-twenty, when the scrolls of fantasy were yet fresh and the waiver wire ran wild as the moors, a solemn covenant was forged among honorable (and occasionally treacherous) lords of the realm.</p>
  <p>Thus was born Ye Olde Dynasty League — a most ancient and enduring fellowship where bloodlines (and trade offers) pass through generations, rosters are kept through famine and feast, and only the most cunning managers may claim eternal glory.</p>
  <p>Here be no fleeting redraft piffle.<br>
We speak of true dynasty — where ye keep thy young squires, thy aging knights, and thy prized warhorses through many a season. Rosters are vast, benches deep, and the wounds of poor trades scar forever.</p>
  <p>Shouldst thou draft wisely, trade shrewdly, and hoard thy future picks like a dragon guards its hoard, thy name shall be sung by bards for ages.<br>
Shouldst thou blunder… thy lineage shall be mocked in the tavern group chat until the end of days.Rules of the Realm (briefly proclaimed):</p>
  <p><b>Rules of the Realm (briefly proclaimed):</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Deep dynasty roster (TBD — but expect many a bench spot)</li>
<li>Rookie drafts most solemn & important</li>
<li>Trades may be cutthroat (beware the dagger in the back)</li>
<li>No mercy for the weak of wallet or will</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>So raise thy goblet (or energy drink), pledge thy allegiance, and enter the lists, noble commissioner and valiant GMs alike.</p>
<p><b>Ye Olde Dynasty League —</b> where legends are born, dynasties endure, and someone will inevitably try to trade their entire future for Jonathan Taylor in year 9.

</p>
<p>Long may ye reign.<br><i>Scribe this upon the sacred Sleeper parchment in the year 2026.</i>
